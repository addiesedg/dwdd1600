        <h1 id="sign">Origins of the Wendigo</h1>
            <p>The story of the Wendigo believed to be a cautionary tale that taught about the importance to avoid and guard against individual greed, selfishness and isolation</p>
            <h2>First Records</h2>
                
            <ul>
            <li>The first known written record of the Wendigo appears in 1636 report by Paul Le Jeanne; who was a French Jesuit Missionary</li>
            <li>Paule Le Jeanne was living with the Algonquin people when a woman of the tribe warned him of a creature that had eaten fellow tribe members and would continue to eat more if Jeanne did not take his teachings somewhere else</li>      
             </ul>
            <h2>Later records</h2>
           
            <ul> 
                <li>In the late 19th century in Canada, a case was reported of a family homicide. The murderur was the father, named Swift Runner explained that he was visited by the Wendigo spirit in his dreams. The spirit told him to kill, cook and eat his wife and five children, to which he did. He was later tried, found guilty and hung for his crimes.</li>
                  </ul>
            <h2>What is happening now?</h2>
            <p>Indigenous artists now and before have been creating art of the Wendigo both literally and figuratively to address multiple issues such as:</p>
                <ul>
            <li>Colonialism</li>
                    <li> Violence</li>
            <li>Environmental Destruction</li>
            </ul>
